# Basic NodeJS ExpressJS application sample

This is Basic NodeJS example Express.js application written fully in TypeScript with ES6 syntax.
Note that you need Node 4.* or later to run this without transpiling to ES5.

The example comes with complete VSCode configuration for TypeScript based projects, but can be used with
any other IDE or editor.

Running this sample within VSCode enables debugging using TypeScript source files (breakpoints set in `.ts` file will be used while debugging).

## Development

```
npm install
tsd install
tsc
export DEBUG="server"
npm start
